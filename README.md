# Fraud Detection in Transactions

## Introduction
This project encompasses the development and comparison of various predictive models with the aim of accurately classifying transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent. The dataset utilized for this study, while scaled and anonymized for privacy, provides a foundation for analyzing crucial characteristics inherent in transaction data.

## Objectives
The primary goals of this project include:

- Analyzing the distribution of the limited data available.
- Generating a balanced sub-dataset with a 50/50 ratio of 'Fraud' to 'Non-Fraud' transactions using the NearMiss Algorithm.
- Evaluating different classifiers to determine which yields the highest accuracy in fraud detection.
- Designing and implementing a Neural Network to benchmark its performance against the most effective traditional classifier.
- Discussing common pitfalls associated with handling imbalanced datasets in the context of fraud detection.
